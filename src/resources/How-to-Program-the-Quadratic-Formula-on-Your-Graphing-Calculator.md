Have you ever been in math class and hoped your graphing calculator could solve the problem for you? Well, there is a way at least for quadratic formula math problems by creating a simple program on your TI-84 graphing calculator.

### **Steps To Program Distance Formula**
1. Press ***prgm*** and slide over to ***NEW***
2. Spell out **QUAD** to name the program
3. Type the following into the **QUAD** program: <br>
a+bi <br>
Prompt A,B,C <br>
(-B−√(B²-4AC))/(2A)→D <br>
(−B+√(B²-4AC))/(2A)→E <br>
Disp D,E <br>

Note: The '-' in front of both B's is a negative sign.
4. To run the program, press ***prgm*** and then search for the program **QUAD**
5. Hit enter on **QUAD** and follow the steps.
